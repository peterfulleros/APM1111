print("The present study investigates the impact of different treatments on the growth of plants, specifically focusing on the weight of the plants. This analysis aims to determine whether there are significant differences in plant weight across different treatment groups. The treatments under investigation include a control group (Ctrl) and two experimental groups (Trt1 and Trt2). The null hypothesis states that there is no significant difference in plant weight between the treatment groups.")

The problem is to determine whether the treatment groups significantly differ in terms of plant weight. This has implications for understanding the effectiveness of different treatments in promoting plant growth.")

# Discussion

print("The analysis revealed significant differences in plant weight across treatment groups, as indicated by the one-way ANOVA results. Post hoc analysis using Tukey's HSD test further identified specific group differences. These findings suggest that the different treatments have a significant impact on plant growth. The visual representation through the boxplot provides an intuitive illustration of the weight distribution across treatment groups.")
